<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Submitted January 3, 2000 - Decided January 19, 
2000<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Judges Petrella and Conley.<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On appeal from Superior Court of New

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opinion of the court was delivered by,<BR>
<P>CONLEY, J.A.D.<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defendant appeals his Municipal Court and, on 
<U>de</U> <U>novo</U> appeal, Superior Court, Law Division, speeding conviction 
and resulting $107 fine. Among the variety of issues raised, he contends that 
the State did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt the necessary basis for 
his conviction of speeding pursuant to <U><A 
href="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/cgi-bin/om_isapi.dll?clientID=446903&amp;Depth=4&amp;advquery=%2239%3a4-98%22&amp;headingswithhits=on&amp;infobase=statutes.nfo&amp;rank=%20%20&amp;record={1372A}&amp;softpage=Q_Frame_Pg42&amp;wordsaroundhits=10&amp;zz=">N.J.S.A.</U> 
39:4-98a. </A>We agree and for that reason alone, we reverse the conviction and 
fine. We need not, therefore, address the other issues raised. We do, however, 
comment on the discovery problems encountered by defendant as we are concerned 
they may reflect an erroneous understanding by the municipal judge of the scope 
of discovery a defendant charged with speeding is entitled to and an unsupported 
conclusion by the Superior Court judge that the municipal prosecutor's 
insistence upon a fee of $25 for the discovery was 
reasonable.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts are not complex. On January 14, 
1997, at 12:56 p.m., the Frenchtown Chief of Police was parked "alongside the 
road in the Plessi parking lot." His patrol vehicle had a K-55 device which was 
in a stationary mode. The Chief was originally trained and certified to operate 
the K-55 device during his initial police academy training in 1968 and, since 
then has been recertified as an operator every five years. His most recent 
certification was issued in May 1996 and expired in May 1999, subsequent to the 
speeding infraction and subsequent to the Chief's municipal court testimony. In 
addition to providing this certification, the State produced an April 27, 1995, 
certificate of calibration for the K-55 device the Chief used and certificates, 
dated September 27, 1996, of the two tuning forks used by the Chief the day of 
the infraction. In this respect, the Chief testified that, using the tuning 
forks both when he first started his patrol and after he issued defendant's 
summons, he determined that the K-55 device was operating accurately. <U>See</U> 
<U>State v. Wojkowiak</U>, <A 
href="http://lawlibrary.rutgers.edu/cgi-bin/caselink.cgi?cite=174%20N.J.Super.%20460">174 
N.J. Super. 460</A>, 463 (App. Div. 1980). <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the 
Chief first observed defendant's vehicle, he was driving northbound on Harrison 
Street and appeared to be exceeding the twenty-five mile per hour speed limit. 
The Chief thought he was driving 45 to 50 miles per hour. There were no other 
cars in the area; when he locked the K-55 onto defendant's vehicle, he got a 
reading of 51 miles per hour. He proceeded after him, and stopped him on Route 
619. The transcript does not reflect how long it took to stop defendant or to 
issue the summons.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the stop and issuance of the 
summons, the Chief said he returned to where he had originally been parked, 
advising the Court that "I think Your Honor should know the reason I was there, 
is that is the time that kindergarten class lets out and this is directly across 
from the Elementary School. And it's been a habit of mine personally as an 
officer, to be there when the school changes classes, when they come and they 
go." At no point, however, did the Chief say that at the time he clocked 
defendant's speed the kindergarten class had "let[] out" or that children were 
in fact changing classes. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are convinced this is 
fatal to the State's case. To be sure, the State established the reliability of 
the K-55 reading beyond any reasonable doubt. And the Chief did refer to posted 
speed signs that indicated the zone was a twenty-five mile per hour speed zone. 
But during defendant's several pretrial efforts to obtain discovery, the State 
expressly waived any attempt to establish a twenty-five mile per hour speed zone 
other than as a school zone within the meaning of <U>N.J.S.A.</U> 39:4-98a.<A 
href="http://lawlibrary.rutgers.edu/decisions/appellate/a2574-98.opn.html#Footnote1" 
name=Footref1>See footnote 1<SUP>1</SUP></A><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant 
thereto, a motorist must not exceed "[t]wenty-five miles per hour, when passing 
through a school zone during recess, when the presence of children is clearly 
visible from the roadway, or while children are going to or leaving school, 
during opening or closing hours. . . . " We have recently construed this 
statutory speed limit provision and, in doing so, rejected the contention that 
<U><A 
href="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/cgi-bin/om_isapi.dll?clientID=446903&amp;Depth=4&amp;advquery=%2239%3a4-98%22&amp;headingswithhits=on&amp;infobase=statutes.nfo&amp;rank=%20%20&amp;record={1372A}&amp;softpage=Q_Frame_Pg42&amp;wordsaroundhits=10&amp;zz=">N.J.S.A.</U> 
39:4-98a </A>establishes "the special speed at all times in a school zone." 
<U>State v. Beierle</U>, <A

N.J. Super. 395</A>, 401 (App. Div. 1999). We held that <U><A 
href="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/cgi-bin/om_isapi.dll?clientID=446903&amp;Depth=4&amp;advquery=%2239%3a4-98%22&amp;headingswithhits=on&amp;infobase=statutes.nfo&amp;rank=%20%20&amp;record={1372A}&amp;softpage=Q_Frame_Pg42&amp;wordsaroundhits=10&amp;zz=">N.J.S.A.</U> 
39:4-98a </A>is applicable only "(1) during school hours, but only during 
recess, when children are clearly visible from the roadway, or (2) when children 
are going to or leaving school during opening or closing hours of school." 
<U>Id.</U> at 400. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The State has the burden of 
showing that the twenty-five mile per hour speed limit applies. <U>State v. 
Tropea</U>, <A 
href="http://lawlibrary.rutgers.edu/cgi-bin/caselink.cgi?cite=78%20N.J.%20309">78 
N.J. 309</A>, 312-13 (1978). During the municipal court trial, the Chief 
testified that, at the time he stopped defendant, he was stationed directly 
across from the elementary school at the time of the stop because that 
ordinarily is the time that kindergarten class lets out. There was no testimony, 
however, that the school was actually in session, and, if so, it was recess 
time, with children visible from the road. Neither was there any evidence that 
children were going to or leaving the school during its opening or closing 
hours. Without such evidence, the State cannot establish beyond a reasonable 
doubt that at the time of the stop, defendant was subject to the school zone 
speed limit of twenty-five miles per hour. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so 
concluding, we observe that our determination has nothing whatsoever to do with 
the credibility of the Chief, accepted by both the Municipal and Superior Court 
judges. We have no reason not to defer to the lower courts' credibility 
determinations. <U>See</U> <U>State v. Locurto</U>, <A 
href="http://lawlibrary.rutgers.edu/cgi-bin/caselink.cgi?cite=157%20N.J.%20463">157 
N.J. 463</A>, 474 (1999). But the difficulty is that what the Chief said was not 
enough _ that it may be his usual habit to set up radar across from the school 
at around 12:56 p.m. because that is when the classes usually let out or change 
does not establish that those were the circumstances extant at the time of 
defendant's stop. At best, they may have been, but a maybe does not "firmly 
convince" us of defendant's guilt, as required under the reasonable doubt 
standard. <U>State v. Medina</U>, <A 
href="http://lawlibrary.rutgers.edu/cgi-bin/caselink.cgi?cite=147%20N.J.%2043">147 
N.J. 43</A>, 61 (1996), <U>cert. denied</U>, <A

S. Ct. 1476</A>, <A 
href="http://lawlibrary.rutgers.edu/cgi-bin/caselink.cgi?cite=137%20L.Ed.2d%20688">137 
L. Ed.2d 688</A> (1997).<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given this conclusion, we 
need not address defendant's<BR>other contentions. We do, however, comment upon 
the discovery problems that developed below. In addition to the materials 
relating to the speed limit which we have set forth in footnote 1, defendant 
sought from the municipal prosecutor copies of the arresting officer's log book 
for January 14, 1997, copies of both sides of the summons, a description of the 
K-55 device, its calibration, and its maintenance and repair history, a copy of 
the calibration certification for tuning forks, a copy of the calibration of the 
police car's speedometer, and the officer's K 55 training and his employment 
history. The prosecutor refused to respond at all to this request until 
defendant paid a $25 "fee."<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding no authority for 
such a "fee," defendant refused to pay it and moved to compel the discovery. 
During argument on the motion, the prosecutor also took the position that 
defendant's discovery rights extended only to what the State was going to rely 
upon to prove its case and further refused to agree to the court's making copies 
of the document for defendant unless defendant agreed not to pursue his 
threatened civil suit over the $25 "fee." <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We comment 
on these aspects of the case to express first our concern over the views 
expressed by both the municipal judge and the prosecutor as to the limits of 
defendant's discovery rights. Under <U>R.</U> 7:4-2(h), the rule in effect at 
the time of appellant's offense, "[d]epositions and discovery in any case in 
which the defendant may be subject to imprisonment or other consequence of 
magnitude if convicted shall be as provided by <U>R.</U> 3:13-2 and <U>R.</U> 
3:13-3 provided that the municipality in which the case is to be tried has a 
municipal prosecutor." Since the time of the offense, this provision has been 
replaced by <U>R.</U> 7:7-7 which provides that when "the government is 
represented by the municipal . . . prosecutor, discovery shall be available to 
the parties only as provided by this rule, unless the court otherwise orders." 
<U>R.</U> 7:7-7(a). Pursuant to <U>R.</U> 7:7-7(b), a defendant is entitled to 
discovery "[i]n all cases involving a consequence of magnitude or when ordered 
by the court . . . . " That rule provides further that the defendant "shall be 
allowed to inspect, copy, and photograph or to be provided with copies of any 
relevant . . . results or reports of . . . scientific tests or experiments made 
in connection with the matter . . . that are within the possession, custody or 
control of the prosecuting attorney books, . . . papers and documents . . . 
within the possession, custody or control of the government; [and] police 
reports that are within the possession, custody or control of the prosecuting 
attorney." <U>R.</U> 7:7-7(b). When a defendant represents himself <U>pro</U> 
<U>se</U> the rule instructs him to make his requests for discovery in writing 
directly to the municipal prosecutor, who "shall respond to the discovery 
request . . . within 10 days after receiving the request." <U>R.</U> 7:7-7(f). 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to potential financial consequences 
related to insurance costs, a defendant charged with violation of <U><A

39:4-98 </A>faces the potential of a fine and/or up to fifteen days of 
incarceration. <U><A

39:4-104. </A>A driver's license suspension may also be imposed. <U><A

39:5-30. </A>We agree with the Superior Court Judge that these consequences are 
of sufficient magnitude to trigger the discovery rights provided formerly by 
<U>R.</U> 7:4-2(h) and presently by <U>R.</U> 7:7-7(b). <U>See</U> <U>State v. 
Polasky</U>, <A 
href="http://lawlibrary.rutgers.edu/cgi-bin/caselink.cgi?cite=216%20N.J.Super.%20549">216 
N.J. Super. 549</A>, 551-54 (Law Div. 1986). <U>Cf.</U> <U>State v. Utsch</U>,

N.J. Super 575</A>, 579 (App. Div. 1982). And, while such discovery rights are 
not without limitation, they can clearly encompass more than discovery of what 
the State intends to produce at trial. <U>See</U> <U>State v. Ford</U>, <A 
href="http://lawlibrary.rutgers.edu/cgi-bin/caselink.cgi?cite=240%20N.J.Super.%2044">240 
N.J. Super. 44</A>, 49 (App. Div. 1990) (municipal court discovery pursuant to 
<U>R.</U> 7:4 2(h) is limited to "relevant items, within the limitations of 
<U>R.</U> 3:13-3(a), which there is a reasonable basis to believe <U>will assist 
a defendant's defense.</U>" (emphasis added)). <U>Compare</U> <U>State v. 
Young</U>, <A 
href="http://lawlibrary.rutgers.edu/cgi-bin/caselink.cgi?cite=242%20N.J.Super%20467">242 
N.J. Super 467</A>, 471 (App. Div. 1990) (in a DWI proceeding, the production of 
ampules from the same batch used in defendant's breathalyzer test is not 
required as a matter of routine discovery when "there is no reasonable basis to 
believe that production . . . will assist in defendant's defense."). 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also express our concern over the $25 "fee" and 
the refusal to provide discovery unless defendant agreed to drop his civil suit. 
We know of no authority for either, and the State cites none. As to the "fee," 
the court rules governing discovery in the municipal court, either those in 
existence of the time of the infraction or currently, do not authorize a 
municipal prosecutor to charge what the prosecutor apparently views as an 
administrative fee to cover his overhead. Moreover, while a copying charge might 
be appropriate, we hardly think a flat $25 fee even approaches a reasonable 
copying charge. <U>See</U> <U>for</U> <U>example</U>, <U><A 
href="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/cgi-bin/om_isapi.dll?clientID=446903&amp;Depth=4&amp;advquery=%2247%3a1A-2%22&amp;headingswithhits=on&amp;infobase=statutes.nfo&amp;rank=%20%20&amp;record={1372A}&amp;softpage=Q_Frame_Pg42&amp;wordsaroundhits=10&amp;zz=">N.J.S.A.</U> 
47:1A-2 </A>(copy charges under Right to Know Law are $.75 per page up to tenth 
page, $.50 per page up to twentieth page and $.25 per page thereafter).

53:2-3 </A>to permit the State police to charge a $10 fee for nonroutine copying 
of certified copies of accident reports and copies of photographs but otherwise 
permitting only copying charges as provided for under the Right to Know law). 
Furthermore, we are troubled by defendant's unaddressed assertion that "[e]very 
town is doing it. And (inaudible) charges $15, Jersey City charges $10, he 
charges $25, so depending on what town you get caught in . . . the costs are 
different." Such practices, if they exist, reflect unequal treatment that we are 
not sure should exist. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope the discovery 
problems here are unique. But we have a sense that the heart of the contention, 
the $25 so-called administrative fee, may be the rule rather than the exception. 
We also sense that defendant's observations of the lack of any consistency from 
one municipality to another may be accurate. We have inquired of the 
Administrative Office of the Courts as to whether there exists any court 
directive on the subject of fees charged by municipal prosecutors as a condition 
of providing discovery. We are told there are none. We are also told that such 
advice more appropriately might come from the Attorney General's office. 
<U>See</U> <U>generally</U>, <U>Kershenblatt v. Kozmor</U>, <A

N.J. Super. 432</A>, 438-39 (Law Div. 1993). <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any 
event, this appeal is not an appropriate vehicle for resolving this issue. But 
we are convinced some thought should be given to establishing a uniform rule 
governing such fees, if they are to be permitted and, accordingly, refer that 
issue to the Supreme Court Criminal Practice Committee and the Committee on 
Municipal Courts for such considerations as they, or the Supreme Court, deem 
appropriate. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reversed and remanded to the Superior 
Court for the entry of an order vacating the conviction and 
fine.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

name=Footnote1><I>Footnote: 1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP>The State 
did so in the following manner. One of defendant's discovery requests consisted 
of "[a]ll documents . . . relating to the establishment of the speed limit on 
Harrison Street," including the "time and date of town meeting to set limit, 
newspapers ads to inform public of the town meeting, notice in newspapers of the 
establishment of speed limit on Harrison St., all documents that you intend to 
use to prove that the speed limit on Harrison St. was legally set. . . . " When 
pressed by the municipal judge during argument on defendant's discovery 
requests, the prosecutor stated that the State would not rely upon a county 
resolution establishing a speed limit as otherwise provided for by <U><A

thereby rendered moot. Thus, when at trial the State sought to introduce a 
county resolution to establish the posted speed other than as a school zone 
twenty-five miles per hour speed limit, the court sustained defendant's 
objections, noting that the State was limited to establishing a speeding 
infraction under <U>N.J.S.A.</U> 39:4-98a.</I>
