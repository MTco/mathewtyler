#Fluoride

##Effects
- Children in high-fluoride areas had significantly lower IQ scores than those who lived in low-fluoride areas, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3491930/
- State prevalence of artificial water fluoridation in 1992 significantly positively predicted state prevalence of ADHD in 2003, 2007 and 2011, even after controlling for socioeconomic status. A multivariate regression analysis showed that after socioeconomic status was controlled each 1% increase in artificial fluoridation prevalence in 1992 was associated with approximately 67,000 to 131,000 additional ADHD diagnoses from 2003 to 2011. Overall state water fluoridation prevalence (not distinguishing between fluoridation types) was also significantly positively correlated with state prevalence of ADHD for all but one year examined, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25890329

- Recent scientific literature reveals a consistent pattern of evidence--hip fractures, skeletal fluorosis, the effect of fluoride on bone structure, fluoride levels in bones and osteosarcomas--pointing to the existence of causal mechanisms by which fluoride damages bones, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9161076
- Mild and severe chronic fluorosis were produced in Wistar rats by feeding them with water containing 10 ppm and 30 ppm fluoride respectively for eight months. There were some different changes in the eighteen blood biochemical indices between mild and severe chronic fluorosis. GSH-px, K+, Ca2+, p2-, Apr and cAMP from these blood biochemical indices were chosen to set up a diagnostic function discriminant of mild and severe chronic fluorosis by the computer., https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2036910
